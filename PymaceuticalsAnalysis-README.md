•	Out of the 4 drugs we analyzed, Capomulin proved to be most effective for:

	1.	Tumor volume reduction 
	2.	Lowering metastatic site spread
	3.	Higher survival rates during treatment  

•	The bar graph that illustrates “Tumor Change Over 45 Day Treatment” shows that Capomulin was the only drug that had a successful effect on decreasing tumor volume:

 	1.	Capomulin decreased tumor volume by 19%, 
 	2.	Infubinol saw an increase in tumor volume of 46%
 	3.	Ketapril saw an increase in tumor volume of 57% 
 	4.	The placebo saw an increase in tumor volume of 51%

•	Capomulin was the only drug that had a survival rate higher than 50% at the end of the 45 day treatment. The survival rate was significantly higher than when compared to the other 3 drugs. 

•	Infubinol and Ketapril seemed to not differ much from the placebo. 

	1.	Both Infubinol and Ketapril had lower metastatic spreads than with the placebo
	2.	At the end of 45 days, the survival rate of Ketapril was equal to the placebo group. Infubinol had the lowest survival rate of all 4. 
	3.	Tumor volume increased for all 3 subject groups, with Ketapril increasing even more so than the placebo group.
